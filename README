1/ HOW TO COMPILE THE PROJECT
To compile the project, you have to use the "make" command.
Just type "make" when you are in the root directory of the project.

2/ HOW TO USE THE PROJECT
Once the project is compiled, you can run the project using:
./main <path> <mode>
Where <path> is the path of the image you want to test and
<mode> is the mode of the command, more details below.
Modes:
    0: Set all the pixels of the image to 1
    1: Do nothing else

It will display the integral image matrix of the original image
and will also generate a file where the results of the Haar
features are written.

After that, you can use the "make clean" command to remove all
the files resulting from the compilation.
